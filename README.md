Quick-Commerce Sales & Operations Analysis Dashboard
Overview

The Quick-Commerce (Q-Commerce) Sales and Operations Dashboard project aims to provide deep insights into the performance of a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) delivery business operating in India’s highly competitive quick-commerce landscape.
With rising competition from Zepto, Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, and BigBasket, the dashboard suite enables management to monitor financial performance, operational efficiency, category trends, and competitive benchmarks — all within a unified Power BI environment.

Problem Statement

The Q-commerce industry in India faces growing pressure to maintain ultra-fast delivery while sustaining profitability and optimizing warehouse operations.
The project’s objective was to design and deliver a data-driven analytics solution that provides actionable insights into:

Revenue, profit, and sales trends

On-time delivery and stock management

Category-wise financial contribution

City-level sales and operational performance

Competitor presence and benchmarking

This solution empowers decision-makers to identify operational bottlenecks, benchmark competitor performance, and strategically optimize supply chain and sales operations.

Project Approach

The project followed a structured five-step methodology for accuracy, scalability, and business impact:

1. Data Ingestion

Collected and consolidated data from multiple internal sources, including:

Orders dataset – order-level data with timestamps, cities, and order values.

Product dataset – SKU-level information, pricing, and category mapping.

Warehouse dataset – delivery time, stock levels, and inventory details.

Partner dataset – data for delivery partners (Zepto, Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, BigBasket).
Performed data cleaning, null handling, and format standardization to ensure data integrity.

2. Data Modeling

Designed a star schema model in Power BI for efficient analytics.

Fact Tables: Orders, Sales, Profit, and Inventory.

Dimension Tables: City, Product Category, Warehouse, and Partner.
The model supports cross-dimensional analysis such as profit by city, inventory by warehouse, and revenue by partner.

3. Analytics Layer (DAX Measures)

Developed key DAX measures to create a dynamic analytics layer:

Financial KPIs: Revenue, Profit, AOV (Average Order Value), Profit Margin (%)

Operational KPIs: On-Time Delivery %, Stock Availability %, Average Inventory

Category Metrics: Category Revenue, Category Profitability

These measures power the dashboard’s interactivity and enable real-time business insights.

4. Visualization (Dashboard Development)

Developed a multi-page Power BI dashboard suite to visualize insights across domains:

Sales & Financial Overview: Summarizes revenue, orders, profit, and AOV.

Warehouse Operations Dashboard: Monitors on-time delivery, stock levels, and inventory health.

City-Level Sales Dashboard: Compares city-wise performance and identifies high-growth regions.

Competitor Analysis Dashboard: Evaluates presence and dominance of Q-commerce competitors across cities.

Category Performance Dashboard: Analyzes profitability and contribution by FMCG categories.

Each page includes intuitive filters, city maps, bar charts, and donut charts for comparative insights.

5. Insights & Recommendations

Derived actionable insights for management, such as:

Identifying top-performing cities and product categories driving revenue growth.

Detecting warehouses with low stock or delayed delivery issues.

Highlighting strong competitor footholds and untapped market zones.

Suggesting inventory balancing and category optimization strategies.
